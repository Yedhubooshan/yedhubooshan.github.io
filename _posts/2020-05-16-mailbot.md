### pip install requests stdiomask bs4 colorama

Packages used:

### Inputs to be given by the user:

1. URL of the website
2. User's mail address

5. Your Budget

## Note for Password:(For better Protection)

## If Lazy: (Less Protection)

## Some Code Explained

### Check and change for your UserAgent (just google and paste in the code)
```python
	headers = {"User-Agent": 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.138 Safari/537.36'}
```

### Colors
- Refer to colorama pypi to learn about the package: [Click Here](https://pypi.org/project/colorama)

### Getting Web Page Info
- Requests is a package in python which helps in http connections.
- BeautifulSoup helps in getting the html code from the website.
```python
	URL = input('Enter URL: ')
	headers = {"User-Agent": 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.138 Safari/537.36'}
	page =  requests.get(URL, headers=headers) #Allows you to send HTTP requests
	soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser') #Getting websites's content
```

### Getting Product Name and Price:

- Find() is used to get the data by entering its variable name.
- We have to give rhe id/attributes to find the variable name.
```python
	title = soup.find('span', attrs={'class':'_35KyD6'}).get_text()
	price = soup.find('div', attrs={'class':'_1vC4OE _3qQ9m1'}).get_text()
```

Go-to amazon/flipkart product page, inspect(f12) and click on the up-left button, keep the cursor on the price & name to get its id/attributes.

### SMTP Library
- SMTP means ***Simple Mail Transfer Protocol*** which helps in sending mail
```python
	server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com',587) #port 587
	server.ehlo() # identify with the server
	server.starttls() #secure protocol establishment
	server.ehlo() 
	server.login(login_id,password) #login
	server.sendmail(login_id,dest_mail,msg) #sennding mail
	server.quit()
```

### Time:
- Sleep function delays the program in seconds.
```python 
	time.sleep(50)
```
